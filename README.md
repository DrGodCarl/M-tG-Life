This is a project to teach me Swfit and to try out any new frameworks or techniques I want to test out. It might eventually become a real thing. Here's a list of things it'll do eventually in rough order of when I'm going to try to do them.

1. Keep track of Magic collection
2. Keep track of Magic decks
3. Life tracker
4. Lookup Magic price data
5. Track Magic price data

As you can see, there's a good chunk of work to be done. I'll start crossing them off as I'm satisfied with where it is.
